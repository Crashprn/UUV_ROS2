# Overview

This repository contains the code that controls the UUV. The code can be found in 2 sections:

###Arduino Code:

This code is how the Arduino communicates with the computer to decode information like motor PWM values and send back messages such as the UUV orientation.



ROS2 Code:

This code is contained within the ros_ws folder, and if you haven't already do the ROS2 tutorials found here: [Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html)

Once you complete the tutorials, a lot of the process for how the code works will be a lot more clear. And because the tutorials are available online ROS2 specific things will not be explained in this documentation.
